      {
        "id": "m5_q1",
        "question": "What's the correct priority order for Claude's memory system?",
        "options": [
          "User > Project > Local",
          "Project > Local > User",
          "Local > Project > User",
          "Local > User > Project"
        ],
        "correct": 2,
        "explanation": "The priority is Local > Project > User, meaning CLAUDE.local.md overrides CLAUDE.md, which overrides ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md."
      },

        "id": "m5_q2",
        "question": "Where should you store team-wide Django conventions?",

          "CLAUDE.local.md",
          "CLAUDE.md in project root",

          "settings.json"
        ],
        "correct": 1,
        "explanation": "Team conventions should go in CLAUDE.md in the project root so they're shared via version control."
      },

        "id": "m5_q3",
        "question": "What file should contain sensitive or personal project preferences?",
        "options": [
          "CLAUDE.md",
          "CLAUDE.global.md",
          "CLAUDE.local.md",
          "CLAUDE.private.md"
        ],
        "correct": 2,
        "explanation": "CLAUDE.local.md is git-ignored by default, making it perfect for sensitive or personal preferences."

          "Maximum of 3 files"
        ],
        "correct": 1,
        "explanation": "You can have CLAUDE.md files in subdirectories to provide directory-specific instructions and conventions."

        "correct": 2,
        "explanation": "The /init command analyzes your project structure and creates a CLAUDE.md file with relevant project information."
